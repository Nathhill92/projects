This project follows along with the [AWS Amplify Workshop](https://amplify-workshop.go-aws.com/).

The original goal of doing this workshop was to attach a website/frontend to my "Notes to Speech" application, but it ended up being a good way to expose me to more developer tools. 
This page is to document the things I learned while doing this workshop.
