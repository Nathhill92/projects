I am overhauling my WordPress project to include some more advanced features

Quick description

* Automate much of the environment with a CloudForamtion template
* Add Parameter Store / Secrets Manager to our configuration files
* Add Patch / Inventory Management to EC2 servers
* Add CodeDeploy to our EC2 servers
* Re-design EFS drive to only store Dynamic contents
* Enhanced monitoring with CloudWatch
* Add Serverless functionality to "disrupt" my environment to generate more scaling events
  * Delete / Stop Webserver
  * Simulate load
  * etc.

Documentation will come later
